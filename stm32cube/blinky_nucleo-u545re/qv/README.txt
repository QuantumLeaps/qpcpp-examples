# Generating Code in STM32Cube

Before building the project, you must generate the code in STM32Cube
(otherwise you'll get compilation errors about missing header files).
Here are the steps to generate code:

1. In the STM32Cibe Project Explorer double click on the "project.ioc" file
   to open it in the MX-view
2. Choose menu: Project | Generate Code


# Code Organization
The code organization conforms to the STM32Cube structure and you
can re-generate the code from Cube. Here are the main directories
and files:

```
<qpcpp>                           // QP/C++ framework installation directory
+---include                       // QP/C++ framework include directory
+---src                           // QP/C++ framework source directory
+---ports                         // QP/C++ framework ports directory
|
+---examples                      // QP/C++ examples directory
|   |   ...
|   +---stm32cube                 // examples for STM32Cube
|   |   +---blinky_nucleo-u545re  // "Blinky" example for NUCLEO-U545RE

|   |   |   |   |           bsp.hpp       // BSP (Board Support Package) header file

|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |       blinky.qm        // "Blinky" model file (for QM)
|   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   .cproject            // STM32Cube project
|   |   |   |   |   .project             // STM32Cube project
|   |   |   |   |   ...
|   |   |   |   |   project.ioc          // STM32MX file (for code generation)
|   |   |   |   |   ...
```
